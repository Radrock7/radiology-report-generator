RADIOLOGY REPORT

The liver is echogenic, suggestive of fatty change. A focal spared area is noted. No focal dominant intrahepatic mass is seen.

The gallbladder is normal. There is no echogenic stone nor gallbladder polyp. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts are not dilated. The common bile duct measures 3.9 mm in diameter.

The pancreas is hyperechoic, suggestive of fatty change. The tail of the pancreas is not visualized. The main pancreatic duct measures 0.6 mm in diameter.

The spleen is normal. An accessory spleen is noted, measuring 8.6 x 5.8 mm.

The kidneys are normal in size and outline. A dilated right renal pelvis is noted with an AP diameter of 19.2 mm, associated with right ureteric dilation and calculi at the proximal ureter (10.9 mm) and distal ureter (16.1 mm); a calculus is also seen in the right interpolar region, measuring 3.6 mm. The previously reported calcification is not visualized in this study.

An abdominal aortic plaque is present, measuring 15.8 x 2.4 mm.

The bladder is not well distended. No significant abnormality detected.

The prostate is enlarged, with a volume of 39.9 cm3. Intra-prostatic calcifications are noted.

IMPRESSION:
Significant right hydronephrosis and ureteric dilation due to obstructing calculi in the proximal and distal right ureter. An additional calculus is noted in the right interpolar region.
Enlarged prostate with intra-prostatic calcifications.
Fatty liver.
Fatty pancreas.
Abdominal aortic plaque.
Accessory spleen.
