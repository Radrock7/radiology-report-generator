RADIOLOGY REPORT

The liver is echogenic, suggestive of fatty change. A focal spared area is noted. No focal dominant intrahepatic mass is seen.

The gallbladder is normal. There is no echogenic stone nor gallbladder polyp. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts are not dilated. The common bile duct measures 3.9 mm in diameter.

The pancreas is hyperechoic, suggestive of fatty change. The tail of the pancreas is not visualized. The main pancreatic duct measures 0.6 mm in diameter.

The spleen is normal. An accessory spleen is noted, measuring 8.6 x 5.8 mm.

The kidneys are normal in size and outline. A calculus is seen in the right interpolar region, measuring 3.6 mm. A calculus is noted at the right proximal ureter, measuring 10.9 mm, and another calculus is noted at the right distal ureter, measuring 16.1 mm. Dilatation of the right renal pelvis with an AP diameter of 19.2 mm and right ureteric dilatation are noted. The previously reported calcification is not visualized in this study.

An abdominal aortic plaque is present, measuring 15.8 x 2.4 mm.

The bladder is not well distended. No significant abnormality detected.

The prostate measures 39.9 cm³ (41.9 x 46.0 x 39.5 mm). Focal calcifications are noted. No significant abnormality detected.

IMPRESSION:
Right hydronephrosis and hydroureter secondary to multiple obstructing calculi in the right proximal (10.9 mm) and distal (16.1 mm) ureter. A 3.6 mm right interpolar renal calculus is also noted.
Enlarged prostate with focal calcifications.
Fatty liver with a focal spared area.
Fatty pancreas.
Abdominal aortic plaque.
Accessory spleen.
Study limited by bowel gas.
